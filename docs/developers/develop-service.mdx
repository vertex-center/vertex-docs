# Develop a service

To create a basic service, you'll need this hierarchy:

```
.vertex
    \- service.json

your-service.sh
```

1. `.vertex/service.json`

    This file allows you to describe your service to Vertex (name, description, dependencies...). Below is an example of service.json file.

    ```json
    {
        "id": "service-id",
        "name": "Service Name",
        "repository": "github.com/vertex-center/service-repository",
        "description": "A small description of your service.",
        "environment": [
            {
                "type": "port",
                "name": "PORT",
                "display_name": "Server Port",
                "default": "8080",
                "description": "The port to expose the API of this server."
            }
        ],
        "methods": {
            "script": {
                "file": "start.sh",
                "dependencies": {
                    "redis": true
                }
            },
            "docker": {
                "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
                "ports": [
                    "6379"
                ],
                "volumes": {
                    "data": "/opt/storage"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. `start.sh`

    This file is the script that Vertex will use to start your service.
    For example, if you want to run a go server, use this:

        ```Shell
        #!/bin/bash

        exec go run .
        ```

    You can use a different name for the file, by changing its name in the `service.json` file.

    :::note
    This script will only be used if the service is installed from sources, or if there are no binaries available in the GitHub releases of the repository.
    :::

These two files are everything you need to convert your program to a Vertex service!
