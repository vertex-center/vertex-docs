# Install new instances

There are three installation methods:

1. **Marketplace**: Download services from our online and certified repository.

2. **Git**: Clone services from GitHub, GitLab...

3. **Local storage**: Point to Vertex the path of an existing service on your computer. Vertex will keep it installed there. This method is recommended to develop new services.

## Procedure

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="marketplace" label="Marketplace">

1. From the homepage, click on `+`.

2. Select _Marketplace_. Then click on _Next_.

3. On the download step:

    - **Service**: Select in the dropdown the service you want to install.

    - **Use Docker**?: Select "yes" if you want to use Docker instead of normal installation.

    :::note
    Vertex was made to avoid Docker. We do not advice to use Docker if you have a low powered computer like a Raspberry Pi. However, Vertex is fully compatible with Docker if you want containerization and all of its advantages.
    :::

    - **Download the precompiled release?:** (only if Docker is disabled) Select "no" if you want to force Vertex to clone the service from sources instead of downloading the precompiled binaries.

4. Click on _Download_. Wait until the end of the download process.

5. Configure the service as you wish, then click on _Save_.

You are now redirected to the service instance page. Enjoy!
