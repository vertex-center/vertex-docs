# Install new instances

There are three installation methods:

1. **Marketplace**: Download services from our online and certified repository.

2. **Git**: Clone services from GitHub, GitLab...

3. **Local storage**: Point to Vertex the path of an existing service on your computer. Vertex will keep it installed there. This method is recommended to develop new services.

## Procedure

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="marketplace" label="Marketplace">

1. From the homepage, click on `+`.

2. Click on _New instance_ next to the service you want to install.

3. In the popup, up to 3 different methods are proposed:

    - **Script**: This is the default method. This will clone the service source code, and install it automatically.

    - **Release**: This will download the latest release published on GitHub, without the source code.

    - **Docker**: This will create a docker container with the service, and manage it automatically.

    :::note
    Vertex was made to avoid Docker. We do not advice to use Docker if you have a low powered computer like a Raspberry Pi. However, Vertex is fully compatible with Docker if you want containerization and all of its advantages.

4. Click on _Download_. Wait until the end of the download process.

Once done, you can go to the Vertex homepage and configure the service as you want.
