# Update Vertex

Updating Vertex is an easy process. In the Web UI, go to **Settings**, then **Updates**.

Updates are fetched every time you click on "Check for Updates". When updates are available, they'll be listed there. Updates should be fast as Vertex is lightweight.

Updating the web client takes effect immediately. However, a server update will need a restart. This is marked with a warning next to the update button.
