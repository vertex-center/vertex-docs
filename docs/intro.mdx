# About

Vertex is a program that allows you to create your self-hosted server easily. Install, configure and start new services in less than a minute.

Vertex is designed to be installed on low-powered computers like Raspberry Pi, so avoiding systems like Docker and prioritizing compiled languages like Go, Rust or C++.
